# Udacity-Computer-Vision-Nano-Degree
Computer Vision Nano Degree Projects on Udacity

Project Overview：

This Nanodegree program is consisted of three projects:

1- Facial Keypoint Detectio: Combining knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system. 

2- Image Captioning: Creating a neural network architecture to automatically generate captions from images. After using the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset to train my network, I will test my network on novel images!

3- Landmark Detection & Tracking (SLAM): Implementing SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world! I’ll combine what you know about robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time. SLAM gives a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features. This is an active area of research in the fields of robotics and autonomous systems.
